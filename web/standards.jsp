                The Good Market is a curated market, which means all vendors have to go through an application and review process, and only vendors that meet the Good Market standards are approved. 
                <br/>These standards are what set the Good Market apart from other markets.  
                <br/>
                <br/>
                

                The Good Market standards have different levels.  <br/>Every product in the market must at least meet the minimum level (Level 1) standards for its product category. 
                Products that have are better for the environment, for society, or for health are at a higher level (e.g. Level 2 or Level 3) 
                <br/>
                <br/>

                Good Market standards are refined and updated over time, and each vendor is encouraged to improve their standards.
